We got interviewed by a local magazine about how studying works in times of Corona. Read the [original German article](https://www.kaenguru-online.de/themen/bildung/online-studium-in-corona-zeiten) or a [Google Translate powered English translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=de&sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaenguru-online.de%2Fthemen%2Fbildung%2Fonline-studium-in-corona-zeiten).
