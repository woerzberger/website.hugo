abstract = "Process models of manifold kinds are extensively used in the field of Business Process Management (BPM). Providing appropriate visualization and editing support for process models is of major importance. This particularly includes support for the adherence to certain modeling constraints. In this paper we report how we leverage tools and frameworks of the Eclipse Modeling Project in order to rapidly develop an editor for different kinds of interrelated process models."
