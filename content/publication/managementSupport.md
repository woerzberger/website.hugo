# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Distributed software development processes are hard to manage due to their creative and dynamic character. In particular, interorganizational development processes deal with the coordination of development activities which are carried out by the engineering teams within several organizations. In this paper, we present our management support of interorganizational development processes based on dynamic process views. Process views allow to manage the partial visibility of processes for external organizations. Our approach explicitly addresses the evolution of such process views onto continuously evolving instances of development processes. The proposed concept is implemented within the process management system AHEAD, which addresses the management of dynamic and distributed software development processes."
