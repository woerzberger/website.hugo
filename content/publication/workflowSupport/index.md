# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Inter-organizational design processes are inefficiently supported by management tools w.r.t. to their dynamic nature and inherent complexity. In this paper, we present an innovative framework for the definition, analysis, improvement, and management of such design processes. Key features are to bridge the gap between modeling and execution of inter-organizational design processes and the seamless execution support for both dynamic and static parts of the overall process both by appropriate process management systems. A case study is given for the conceptual design process of a plant for polyamide 6 production by hydrolytic polymerization. "
